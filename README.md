# Purpose

The purpose of this software project is to provide a basis for the
development of the *Wavo Link Harvester* that will allow users to submit
the music-video *links and* *embedded objects* contained in a webpage to
the wavo servers for further processing.

This module will eventually be extended to allow users to save
music-videos from across the web and save them in their wavo
collections.

As a secondary purpose, the following module will be given as an
assignment to *Baptiste Bonnaudet* in
order to assess his programming skills as well as his ability to work in
an autonomous fashion when provided with general requirements.

# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Gathering Elements

#### Gathering Links Elements

The following URI types must be gathered :

-   youtube links

-   Vimeo links

-   soundcloud links

#### Gathering Embedded Objects

The following embedded objects types must be gathered :

-   youtube links

-   Vimeo links

-   soundcloud links

#### Gathering iframe Elements

The following iframe types must be gathered :

-   youtube links

-   Vimeo links

-   soundcloud links

### Logging Content to the Console

The elements gathered must be printed *console.log* as they are found in
the DOM.

This logging facility must be easily extensible in order to allow
reporting to the wavo servers in the future.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

##### Documentation

Each of the moduleâ€™s routine/functions needs to be properly documented
using (jsDocs)[http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Comments#Comments]. The required jsDocs elements are *@param*, *@return*,
and *@constructor* when applicable.

##### Extensibility

The module must be easily extensible in order to allow for the gathering
of object types other than *links* *embedded objects*., or *iframes.*

Each of these sub-modules must also be easily extensible in order to
allow, for example, the gathering of additional *types* of link.

##### Maintainability

The module must be easily maintainable for all users. Hence, the code is
supposed to loaded from a central public repository when the user
activates the bookmarklet.

The using the following code snippet as the bookmarked URI should allow
the fulfillment of this requirement :

    javascript:(function(){
      var a = document.createElement('script');
      a.setAttribute('src', JS_MODULE_URI);document.body.appendChild(a);}
    )();

##### Licensing

In order to avoid costly legal process, this software will have to be
released under the (MIT License)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT\_License].

Hence it should bare the following license on top of all its files :
